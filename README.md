# Wave Function Collapse Algorithm

I learned about the algorithm recently and wanted to try messing around with it.

To challenge and prove to myself that I understood the algorithm, I decided to first implement it with C.
For this, I hardcoded in the tile set and relationships between them.

Next, I plan to use Python to take an image as input and programmatically get the tile set and relationships.

After that, I want to try to implement it using JavaScript so I can put it directly on my personal website.
